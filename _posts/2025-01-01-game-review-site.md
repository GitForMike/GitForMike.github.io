title: A Tier List Website for Popular Games
---

I'm excited to share my latest personal project: a website that provides a simple and intuitive way to explore popular games and their character tier lists. 
Check out my project: **[https://gitformike.github.io/tier/](https://gitformike.github.io/tier/)**

This project was born out of my passion for gaming and my desire to create a useful tool for fellow gamers. I wanted to build a platform where users could easily find information about trending games and quickly understand the relative strengths of different characters or units within those games.

## Key Features

*   **Concise Game Introductions:** The website offers brief overviews of currently popular games, giving users a quick understanding of each game's premise and gameplay.
*   **Interactive Tier Lists:** The core feature is the interactive tier list UI. This allows users to visualize character rankings in a clear and organized manner.
*   **Customizable Tier Lists with Image Uploads:** A unique aspect of this project is the ability for users to create their own tier lists by uploading images. This empowers users to create highly personalized tier lists based on their own experiences and preferences. This feature allows for a high degree of customization and community engagement.

## Technologies Used

This project was built using **Next.js**, a popular React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation for improved performance and SEO. This allows for a fast and efficient user experience.

## Future Plans

I plan to continue improving this project by:

*   Adding more games and updating the tier lists regularly.
*   Improving the overall design and user experience.

I welcome any feedback or suggestions you may have! Please feel free to explore the website and let me know what you think.

Thank you for your interest!
