title: A PDF Question Answering Tool using Transformers.js
---

I'm excited to share my latest personal project: a website that allows you to upload a PDF document and ask questions about its content, leveraging the power of AI directly in your browser. You can check it out here: **[https://mike.hndblog.com/doc_ai/](https://mike.hndblog.com/doc_ai/)**

This project was born out of my interest in making AI tools more accessible and convenient. I wanted to create a solution that could analyze PDF documents and provide answers to user questions without requiring any server-side processing.

## Key Features

*   **PDF Upload and Analysis:** Users can easily upload PDF documents directly through the website.
*   **Question Answering:** After uploading a PDF, users can ask questions related to the document's content. The AI model attempts to provide relevant answers based on its analysis.
*   **Client-Side Processing with Transformers.js:** The entire analysis and question answering process happens client-side using Transformers.js, eliminating the need for a server and ensuring user privacy.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following technologies:

*   **Transformers.js:** A JavaScript library from Hugging Face that brings pre-trained transformer models to the browser. This is the core technology behind the PDF analysis and question answering capabilities.
*   **Next js:** The primary programming language for the front-end development.

## How it Works

1.  **PDF Parsing:** The uploaded PDF is parsed to extract the text content.
2.  **Model Loading:** A pre-trained transformer model is loaded using Transformers.js.
3.  **Question Answering:** When a user asks a question, the model processes the question and the extracted text from the PDF to generate an answer.
4.  **Client-Side Execution:** All of these steps are executed directly in the user's browser, without sending any data to a server.

## Limitations

As this is a lightweight, client-side implementation using a smaller model, there are some limitations:

*   **Token Limits:** Due to the resource constraints of running a model in the browser, there's a limit to the number of tokens (words or sub-word units) the model can process at once. This can sometimes lead to incomplete or slightly inaccurate answers, especially for very long documents or complex questions.
*   **Accuracy:** While the model strives to provide accurate answers, it's important to remember that it's still an AI and may occasionally make mistakes.

## Future Plans

I plan to continue improving this project by:

*   Exploring techniques to handle longer documents more effectively within the browser's constraints.
*   Investigating different models to potentially improve accuracy.
*   Improving the user interface and overall user experience.

I welcome any feedback or suggestions you may have! Please feel free to explore the website and let me know what you think.
