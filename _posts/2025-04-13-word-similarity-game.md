title: Unleash Your Inner Word Detective with WordLink - The English Word Similarity Game!
---

Hey word puzzle enthusiasts! I'm thrilled to introduce WordLink, my latest creation – an engaging English word similarity game inspired by the popular Semantle. If you enjoy linguistic challenges and have a knack for connecting words, then WordLink is the perfect brain-teasing adventure for you!

### Inspired by a Classic: The WordLink Concept

WordLink draws its core concept from the captivating gameplay of Semantle (also known as 꼬맨틀 in Korean). The objective is simple yet profoundly engaging: guess a secret target word by making educated guesses and observing how semantically similar your guesses are to the target. Unlike traditional word guessing games that rely on exact letter matches, WordLink delves into the *meaning* of words.

### How to Play: Unraveling Semantic Connections

Each guess you submit in WordLink is analyzed for its semantic similarity to the secret target word. The game provides you with a similarity score, indicating how closely your guess aligns in meaning with the hidden word. This score acts as your compass, guiding you closer to the target with each attempt.

Furthermore, WordLink presents your guesses in a ranked list based on their semantic proximity to the target word. This visual representation allows you to track your progress and identify patterns in the semantic landscape surrounding the secret word. By carefully analyzing the similarity scores and the ranked list, you can strategically refine your subsequent guesses and inch closer to the solution.

### Built with Cutting-Edge Technology: Flutter, Word2Vec, and TensorFlow Lite

WordLink is powered by a robust technological foundation to deliver a smooth and intelligent gaming experience:

* **Flutter:** This cross-platform framework by Google allowed for the creation of a fluid and visually appealing app that performs seamlessly on Android devices.
* **Word2Vec:** This powerful natural language processing technique is at the heart of WordLink's semantic analysis. Word2Vec models words as numerical vectors in a high-dimensional space, where words with similar meanings are located closer to each other. This enables the game to accurately measure the semantic similarity between your guesses and the target word.
* **TensorFlow Lite (TFLite):** To ensure optimal performance and a lightweight app size, the pre-trained Word2Vec model has been optimized and deployed using TensorFlow Lite. TFLite is Google's mobile library for running machine learning models on edge devices, ensuring a fast and responsive gameplay experience directly on your phone.
