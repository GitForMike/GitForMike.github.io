title: Enhancing Transparency in Seoul Villa Market - Introducing Villa Web & App
---

Hello! I'm Mike, a developer passionate about solving real-world problems through technology. I'm excited to announce the launch of my latest project: the Villa web service and app, designed to bring transparency to the Seoul villa (multi-family housing) market. This initiative aims to address the prevalent issue of jeonse (lump-sum deposit lease) fraud in Korea by providing accessible and reliable villa price information.

### The Challenge: Opaque Villa Market in Seoul

Unlike the relatively transparent apartment market, villa prices in Seoul are often obscure. This lack of transparency has led to numerous cases of jeonse fraud, causing significant distress and financial loss to many individuals. To combat this issue, I developed Villa, a service that provides real-time villa price data based on official government sources.

### Villa Web Service: Real-time Price Data Powered by Government Data

The Villa web service, accessible at [https://mike.hndblog.com/villa/](https://mike.hndblog.com/villa/), offers up-to-date transaction and jeonse prices for villas in Seoul, sourced directly from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport. Users can easily search for villa prices by address.

* **Key Features:**
    * Recent transaction history and trend analysis
    * User-friendly interface
* **Tech Stack:**
    * Next.js: For optimal performance and user experience
    * sql.js: For efficient client-side SQL database handling

### Villa App: Villa Prices at Your Fingertips

To further enhance accessibility, I've also launched the Villa app, which provides the same functionality as the web service in a mobile-friendly format. The app is available for download on the Google Play Store:

### Expected Impact

I believe that the Villa web service and app will have a significant positive impact on the Seoul villa market by:

* Increasing transparency in villa price information
* Preventing jeonse fraud and enhancing transaction safety
* Empowering users to make informed decisions
* Reducing information asymmetry in the real estate market

### Future Plans

Looking ahead, I plan to further enhance Villa by:

* Expanding data coverage and accuracy
* Adding personalized features such as price alerts and trend notifications
* Building a community platform for user interaction and expert advice
* Supporting more platforms

My goal is for Villa to become a trusted resource for anyone seeking reliable villa price information in Seoul.

### Conclusion

I'm excited to share Villa with you and welcome any feedback or suggestions. Thank you for your support!
